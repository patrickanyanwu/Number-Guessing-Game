This mini project creats a number guessing game that consists of a random number being generated.
The user is allowed to chose a difficulty and depending on the difficulty they chose the number of lives they have to guess the number varies.
The game also tells the user if the number they guessed is too low or too high to assist them while playing.
Numberous if statements and while loops are utilised in this code to give this outcome.
